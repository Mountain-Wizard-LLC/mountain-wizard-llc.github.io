                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Mountain Wizard LLC was founded in Fairfield, Montana. My journey into designing t-shirt prints began when I wanted to surprise my girlfriend with something creative and meaningful. When we first met, we were paddleboarding in Hidden Bay on Swan Lake in Montana. We spent hours out on the paddleboards, so much so that we should have had hypothermia. Drawing on my skills in drafting, 3D printing, art, photography, and Photoshop, I set out to capture that scene in an image. Rather than taking a simple photo and slapping it onto something, I wanted to create silhouette work that was unique and evocative.</p>

                <h2>Making the Sweatshirt</h2>
                <p>This is the story behind the first t-shirt design I made. It was inspired by the memorable experience at Swan Lake and my desire to create something special and personal. My approach was to use silhouette work to capture the essence of that moment.</p>

                <h2>The Company Name</h2>
                <p>The name "Mountain Wizard" comes from various nicknames I've acquired throughout my life. "Mountain" is derived from the translation of Montana, which means "mountain" in Spanish. Growing up, I had the nickname "Mountain Man" in football because of my ability to carry two 5-foot-tall tackling dummies, one on each shoulder. The "Wizard" part comes from a nickname I earned in school. In my small farm town, there weren't many people who were tech-savvy. I had a natural aptitude for fixing any technology I got my hands on, almost like I was using magic, so I was dubbed the "Tech Wizard."</p>
